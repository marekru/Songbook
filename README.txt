II. Obtaining Documentation

There are two main sources of documentation for this software:

    1. If you are a Windows user not already familiar with LaTeX,
       double-click the "Tutorial" icon in the Songbook folder to read
       an introductory tutorial.  To open the file you will need a
       PDF reader.  (If you don't already have one, you can obtain
       Adobe Acrobat Reader for free from www.adobe.com.)

    2. The LaTeX documentation for the Songs package can be viewed by
       opening the "Reference Manual" link in the Songbook folder.
       Again, a PDF reader is required to open the file.

Both of these documents can also be viewed online at songs.sourceforge.net.

If you don't see icons for "Tutorial" and "Reference Manual" in the Songbook
folder, then it probably means that MiKTeX was not already installed when you
installed this software.  To fix the problem you should first install MiKTeX
(which can be obtained for free from www.miktex.org) and then reinstall this
software (see the instructions below).


III. Removal / Reinstallation

To uninstall the Songs package, double-click on the "uninstall" icon in the
Songs folder.  This will remove all files and registry keys created by the
installation.  It will NOT remove MiKTeX, Vim, or Adobe Acrobat Reader; if
you wish to uninstall these applications you should follow the removal
instructions that were provided with each of those products.  The uninstaller
will also avoid deleting any files in the Songbook folder that you may have
modified since installation.  If you don't wish to keep these files, you can
delete the Songbook folder after running the uninstaller.

To reinstall the software, you should first uninstall any previous version
of the Songs package by following the directions above.  Next, install
MiKTeX (from www.miktex.org) and Vim (from www.vim.org) if you don't already
have them.  Finally, download the latest Songs installer from
songs.sourceforge.net and run it to install the Songs package.  Both MiKTeX
and Vim must be installed BEFORE running the Songs installer, otherwise
many important features will be omitted.
